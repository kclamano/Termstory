## 14. Extended Commands & Features

In addition to the core TUI dashboard and daily timeline, TermStory features a suite of advanced CLI subcommands:

### 🧠 Ask (Natural Language Q&A)
Use semantic Q&A and search over your developer history. `termstory ask` retrieves relevant sessions using BM25 context retrieval combined with LLM processing to answer questions like:
- `termstory ask "What did I work on last Monday?"`
- `termstory ask "When did I fix the database deadlocks?"`

### 🔮 Predict (Pre-Cognitive Workspace)
The pre-cognitive workspace predicts what project or workspace you will work on next based on historical transition probabilities and time-of-day patterns.
- `termstory predict`
- `termstory predict --top 5`
- `termstory predict --json`
- `termstory predict --days 30`

### 🎮 Gamification & Personality Profiles
- **RPG Class Alter Ego (`termstory rpg-class`)**: Automatically profiles your developer style into daily classes (e.g. *Regex Sorcerer*, *Docker Demolitionist*) based on commands executed, with optional AI biography generation.
- **Vampire Coder Index (`termstory vampire-index`)**: Measures late-night work intensity by tracking commands and commits done between midnight and 5:00 AM.
- **Project Necromancer Score (`termstory necromancer`)**: Measures the resurrection frequency of stale projects that were dormant for 6+ months.
- **Rage-Quit Signatures (`termstory rage-quit`)**: Analyzes the final terminal command run right before 12h+ coding breaks to identify patterns in how sessions end.

### 💢 Anger Translator (`termstory anger-translator`)
Translates developer commits and preceding terminal error diagnostics/rebuild attempts into emotional roasts and real internal states.

### 🔮 Fortune Teller (`termstory fortune-teller`)
Scans late-night chaotic sessions (such as bypass-tests, frantic commit iterations, rapid edits) to generate witty Monday-morning bug fortunes and predictions.

### ⏱️ Database Profiler (`termstory profile`)
Profiles database query execution times and identifies N+1 read patterns to help keep the TermStory TUI/CLI extremely fast.

### 📹 Replay (Terminal Session Playback)
Replay the exact commands and delays of a past development session directly in your terminal like a movie.
- `termstory replay`
- `termstory replay <session_id>`
- `termstory replay --speed 2.0`
- `termstory replay --list`

### 💡 Insights (Executive Focus & Activity)
Calculate developer focus scores, time-of-day work distributions, and project focus metrics to highlight active days, total durations, and main achievements.
- `termstory insights`

### 🌐 Web (HTML Report Generator)
Generate and automatically open a beautiful, high-density HTML report of your TermStory history and AI chronicles in your web browser.
- `termstory web`

### 📤 Export (Structured Data Export)
Export all or filtered sessions as JSON or CSV files to share or perform custom analysis.
- `termstory export --format json`
- `termstory export --format csv --output history.csv`

### 📊 Stats (Detailed Work Telemetry)
Compute and display high-density, CLI-native command category breakdown tables, tool usage, and terminal telemetry.
- `termstory stats`

### 🏷️ Tags (Session Classification)
Auto-classify and tag sessions (`deploy`, `debug`, `setup`, `test`, `docs`) based on shell commands and git commit messages.
- `termstory tags`
- `termstory tags debug`
- `termstory tags --rebuild`

### 🗄️ Archive (`termstory archive`)
Archive older sessions, commands, commits, and summaries (older than N days) into a separate archive database file to keep the active database lean.
- `termstory archive --days 90`

### 💾 Backup & Restore (`termstory backup` / `termstory restore`)
Create timestamped database backups or restore your database from a backup file in case of corruption or data migration.
- `termstory backup`
- `termstory restore /path/to/backup.db`

### 📅 Timeline (`termstory timeline`)
Render a high-density ASCII visual activity chart and timeline of command distributions over the recent days.
- `termstory timeline`
- `termstory timeline --days 30`

### 📓 Notebook (`termstory notebook`)
Export your terminal sessions as a clean, chronological Markdown journal/notebook grouped by day, optionally filtered by project or date range.
- `termstory notebook`
- `termstory notebook --project myapp --since 7`

### ⏰ Reminders (`termstory remind`)
Schedule, list, and manage reminders linked to specific sessions (e.g. reminding yourself of a task in a few days).
- `termstory remind "follow up on bug fix" --days 2`
- `termstory remind --list`
- `termstory remind --complete 1`

### ⚙️ Reset (`termstory reset`)
Reset all TermStory state, clear the SQLite database, and wipe the configuration file back to clean defaults.
- `termstory reset`

### 🔍 Observability Relay (`termstory obs`)
Toggle observability settings (such as Nemo relay / DeepWiki settings) for Hermes via local `.env` and `config.yaml` updates.
- `termstory obs`
